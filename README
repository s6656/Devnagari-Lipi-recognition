Devnagari-Lipi-recogniion

This code successfully recognizes hindi characters.

Technique Used
I have used convolutional neural networks. I am using Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.

Architecture
CONV2D --> MAXPOOL --> CONV2D --> MAXPOOL -->FC -->Softmax--> Classification
Some additional points
You can go for additional conv layers.
Add regularization to prevent overfitting.
You can add additional images to the training set for increasing the accuracy.


Python Implementation
Dataset- DHCD (Devnagari Character Dataset)
Images of size 32 X 32

CNN accuracy= 96.600
CNN error= 3.4000000000000057
